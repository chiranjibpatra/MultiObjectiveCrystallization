Multiobjective Optimization of Unseeded and Seeded Batch Cooling Crystallization Processes


Multiobjective optimization (MOO) of batch cooling crystallization is carried
out for the development of optimal operating recipes for unseeded and seeded crystallization
processes. Mean size and coefficient of variation (CV) are the two objectives considered for
unseeded batch cooling crystallization of paracetamol, whereas mean size, CV, and nucleated
mass are considered as objectives for the seeded batch cooling crystallization of potassium
nitrate. In this work, along with finding the optimal temperature trajectories, the effect of
choice of objectives on the final achievable Pareto front is analyzed using two different
objective functions, namely number mean size and surface-weighted mean size. Further, the
capability of MOO is also exploited to determine the feasible ranges of combinations of seed
properties like initial seed mass and seed mean size for better crystal size distribution (CSD)
